# Data Versioning Examples

This repository contains example projects demonstrating two approaches to data version control.

## Projects

### 1. DVC Project (Wine Quality Prediction with MLOps)

[dvc-test/](./dvc-test)

An ML project example using DVC (Data Version Control) and MLflow:
- Data and model version control with DVC
- Experiment tracking and model registry management with MLflow
- Practical example using wine quality prediction model

Key Features:
- Data/model version control (DVC)
- Experiment metadata tracking (MLflow)
- Model training and registration pipeline
- AWS S3 integration

### 2. LakeFS Project (Image Segmentation with MLOps)

[lakefs-test/](./lakefs-test)

Example of data version control and MLOps pipeline using LakeFS:
- Data version control with LakeFS
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Image segmentation model training and inference

Key Features:
- Git-like data version control (LakeFS)
- Branch-based experiment management
- Model training and registration pipeline
- MinIO integration
